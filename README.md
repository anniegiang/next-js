**Next.js**

Notes
- Create scripts in package.json to run next.
- Create a `pages` directory in the root directory.
  - React components go in here.
- Next creates routes for each page.
  - Name of components do not affect routing.
  - Each route is named after the name of the page file.
    - ex: `about.js` => `http://localhost:3000/about`
